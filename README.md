# User Data Analysis Project (Python)

This repository contains a step-by-step user data analysis project built to
practice core data science concepts using Python.

The project works with a social-network-style dataset containing:
- users
- their connections (friends)
- pages they have interacted with

The goal is to understand how raw, nested data is transformed into clean,
analysis-ready data and then used to build simple recommendation features.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Practice loading and handling nested JSON data
- Understand and explore DataFrame structure
- Identify and clean data quality issues
- Apply data analysis using pandas and NumPy
- Build basic recommendation logic
- Visualize insights using matplotlib and seaborn 

The project is developed **incrementally**, following real-world data science
workflows.
